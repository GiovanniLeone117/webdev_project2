    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/about_me_img.jpg" alt="Me arm wrestling an opponent at a competition" width="500" height="300"> 
    <p>Hello! I'm Giovanni Leone, a graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) with a degree in marketing. While my education gave me a solid foundation in business, my true passion lies in fitness. Fitness is at the heart of everything I do. I'm a competitive arm wrestler, constantly pushing myself to new limits, and I love helping others pursue their own fitness goals. Whether it's strength training, nutrition, or mindset, I'm committed to supporting people on their journey to becoming the best version of themselves. Through my own experiences and challenges, I've learned the importance of consistency, dedication, and community, and I'm excited to share that knowledge with others. My mission is to inspire, motivate, and help people realize their potential, both in and out of the gym.</p>

	  <h3>My other passions</h3>
      <p>When I’m not training or coaching, I love exploring new ways to improve my performance. I’m always reading about sports science, trying new training philosphies. I am also a big fan of spending time outdoors, regardless of the outside weather. I find that getting outside is essential for staying mentally refreshed.</p>
